			<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today. Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is made up of many different conditions characterized by challenges in oneâ€™s everyday life, such as social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. Therefore, conflicts arise due to there being many different subtypes of autism rather than just one type of autism.</p>
			<p> The goal of our website is to help everyone become more aware and informed about what autism entails, where we highlight the spectrum of the disorder, an assortment of treatment types, the resources available to those who are affected by it, and more. Furthermore, a quiz will be made available to help others realize whether or not they or a loved one should seek treatment. </p>
