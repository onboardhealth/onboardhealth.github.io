				<h3> Therapies  </h3>
				<h3> Medications </h3>
				<h3> Specialists </h3>
				</ul>
				<p> Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. While there is no cure for the disorder, there are several treatments that can be used to help manage some of the symptoms. Talking with therapists and specialists in conjunction with medication can be extremely helpful for both children and adults who have the disorder. There are various options for each treatment type described below.</p>

				<h2> Types of Therapy </h2>

				<h3> Occupational Therapy </h3>
				<p> The overall goal with this type of therapy is to help people with Autism be as independent as possible by helping to improve one's home and school life.</p>
				<h3> Speech Therapy </h3>
				<p> Speech therapy can help to improve both verbal and nonverbal communication for an individual with Austism. This in turn can help these individuals better form relationships leading them to be more highly functional in everyday life.</p>
				<h3> Physical Therapy </h3>
				<p> Physical Therapy helps children build muscle strength and control so that he or she can get along better with other children.</p>
				<h3> Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)</h3>
				<p> This is an applied therapy technique that reinforces positive behavior and attempts to teach new skills through the use of a rewards system.</p>
				<p> The different types of ABA include Discrete Trial Training, Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, Pivitol Response Treatment, and Verbal Behavior Intervention.</p>

				<h2> Types of Medication</h2>

				<p> The only drug approved by the FDA for children with autism is Risperidone. It can help reduce irritability for children between 5 and 16 years of age. It has proven to be most effective when used in combintion with behavioral therapies.</p>
				<p> While Risperidone is the only medication that is FDA approved for austism spectrum disorder, there are other medications that one can consider taking to help. Depending on the severity of one's specific symptions, there are three general categories of medications that are typically appropriate for individuals with autism:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Those that are currently used to treat ADHD symptoms, either simulants or non-simulants.</li>
					<li> Anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications, most commonly sertraline(Zoloft) or fluoxetine(Prozac) for children.</li>
					<li> Anti-psychotic medications, such as Rsperdal or Abilify.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2> Types of Specialists</h2>

				<p> Asking for advice by reaching out to a specialist is always a good idea! There is a long list of medical physicians who would be more than willing to provide advice on next steps one can take. Therapists of all types, clinical psychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, and primary care providers would all be great resources. They are either specialists themselves or could lead you to the best specialist for your specific needs.</p>
				<h2> Ongoing Studies in Search of More Treatment Options</h2>
				<p> There are several ongoing research projects that are working towards helping children with autism spectrum disorder. There has been a relatively recent shift in research that has moved away from looking for a cure and has moved towards developing methods that will help children with autism grow up to live their lives to the fullest. Along with developing these methods, specialists are researching genetics in search of a cause, potential new medications for the symptoms, biometrics, and technology innovations that will allow children with autism to grow and learn at a faster pace.</p>
